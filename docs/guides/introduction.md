# Why should I care?

These days, everything you do is monitored. You might think that since it's so obvious, we shouldn't worry about it. Don't be so sure. Most large organizations owe their fortunes to selling your data. That's why it's so important to become independent of these tech giants. Everything they collect can affect us negatively now or in the future. Privacy is a human right that is no longer respected, and now it's up to us to get as close as we can to that ideal.

# I have nothing to hide.

Many people think they don't have much to hide. But they change their minds when they find out just how much they have to hide, and how much of that information is already out there. All the messages you write on Messenger, your full search history and your intimate messages with your drug dealer - it's all out there, waiting to be bought by advertisers. Saying you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't need clothes to go out - online privacy is the clothes. Without it, we are naked in the eyes of privacy-invading companies.
