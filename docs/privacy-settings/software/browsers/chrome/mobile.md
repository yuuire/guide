::: warning
We recommend not using Chrome, as it's controlled by Google and is notoriously known for being one of the worst browsers in the context of privacy. Manifest V3 is already here, and it effectively cripples the capabilities of ad and tracker blockers. You can learn more about MV3 on EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation). On top of that Chrome on mobile doesn't even have extensions, which is a basic functionality of Gecko-based browsers like Firefox.
