# Microsoft Edge Mobile

::: warning
We don't recommend using Edge because it's controlled by Microsoft and is notorious for being one of the worst browsers for privacy. Manifest V3 is already here, and it effectively cripples the capabilities of ad and tracker blockers. You can read more about MV3 at the EFF [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening) and [here](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/googles-manifest-v3-still-hurts-privacy-security-innovation).
