# Android Settings
By enabling all of these settings, you are significantly reducing the amount of tracking and data collection these devices perform, but keep in mind that you are not completely eliminating it if you are not using a privacy-oriented custom ROM.

::: info
Due to the nature of Android devices, the exact layout of the menu may vary from device to device.

::: info
It is possible to use an Android device without ever signing into a Google account for added privacy. This must be done during device setup. You can use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) to procure many [open source](/guides/prologue/open-source) apps, and [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com) as a proxy for the Play Store for anything else you can't get on F-Droid. Note that with Aurora you will not be able to use Google to process app-related payments such as subscriptions or one-time payments to download the app. In these cases, it should be possible to sign into the Play Store exclusively without signing into Google on the entire device.
