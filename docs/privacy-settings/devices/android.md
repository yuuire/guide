::: info
It is possible to use an Android device without ever signing in to a Google account for added privacy. This must be done during device setup. You can use [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) to get many [open source](/guides/prologue/open-source) apps, and [Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com) as a proxy for the Play Store for anything else you can't get on F-Droid. Note that with Aurora you will not be able to use Google to process app-related payments, such as subscriptions or one-off payments to download the app. In these cases, you should be able to sign in to the Play Store only without signing in to Google on the whole device.
