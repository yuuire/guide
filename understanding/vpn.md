# VPN Overview
In recent years, the concept of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) has gained significant attention, often propelled by the endorsements of social media influencers. However, the reality behind VPNs starkly contrasts with the promises made, leading to misconceptions and misinformed decisions among users.

## Misrepresentation by Influencers
VPN’s have become a popular tool, largely because of how influencers make it seem like they are necessary for online privacy and security. There is no avoiding the claims that their advertisements promise to hide internet traffic, avoid surveillance, and make anonymous surfing possible. However, these assertions are far from true. Though many VPN providers claim not to keep records on customers’ activities, this has proven false in many cases. Therefore, there is a cause for alarm about the integrity of virtual private network (VPN) services.

## Practical Utility for Home Users
The idea that an average family would need VPNs is simply not true. On the contrary, using VPNs can lead to inconveniences while trying to access banking websites or merchant accounts leading to fraud detection systems picking up unusual traffic patterns thereby causing problems when the user wants to use such sites as entering their details before browsing. This means that VPNs may be impractical in ordinary online activities.

## Limited Use Cases
Despite their drawbacks, VPNs do offer utility in specific scenarios. For instance, when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks, which are inherently insecure, a VPN can encrypt traffic and shield sensitive data from potential eavesdropping. Similarly, VPNs can help bypass geographical restrictions imposed by content providers, allowing users to access region-locked content from anywhere in the world.

## Privacy Concerns and Trust Issues
Using a VPN requires trusting a third-party service provider. Therefore, privacy concerns arise since there is a possibility that the VPN providers may monitor users’ activities or logs leading to the defeat of the purpose of using a VPN for anonymity reasons. Most importantly, where a given virtual private network (VPN) company operates significantly determines the amount of privacy it offers; especially with regard to international data retention laws and intelligence agencies spying on its clients all over the world.

## Risks and Considerations
Despite their intended benefits, VPNs are not foolproof solutions. Users should remain vigilant about potential risks associated with VPN usage, including susceptibility to DNS hijacking, SSL stripping attacks, and vulnerabilities in network equipment. Understanding these risks empowers users to make informed decisions regarding the necessity and appropriateness of VPN usage in their specific contexts.

If you are looking for **anonymity**, you should use the [Tor Browser](/recommendations/internet-browsing/tor). If you're looking for added security, you should always ensure you're connecting to websites using **HTTPS**.

A **VPN** is not a replacement for good security practices.
